Note
The book created a controversy with much of the press and caused Bruno Bauer to attempt to refute the book in an article published in Wigand's [de] Vierteljahrsschrift in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal Gesellschaftsspiegel [de] in January 1846.

Should add those articles in
